                <strong>Kedarnath</strong> is a town in the <strong>State</strong> of <strong>Uttarakhand</strong> in
                <strong>India</strong> and has gained importance because of the
                <strong>Kedarnath
                    Temple</strong>. It is a <strong>Nagar panchayat</strong> in <strong>Rudraprayag district</strong>.
                The most remote of the four <strong>Chota Char Dham</strong>
                Pilgrimage sites, Kedarnath is located in the <strong>Himalayas</strong>, about 3,583 m (11,755 ft)
                above <strong>sea level</strong> near
                Chorabari Glacier, the source of the <strong>Mandakini river</strong>, and is flanked by snow-capped
                peaks, most
                prominently
                the Kedarnath Mountain. The nearest road head is at <strong>Gaurikund</strong> about 16 km away. The
                town suffered
                extensive
                destruction during June 2013 from the <strong>Flash Floods</strong> caused by torrential rains in
                <strong>Uttarakhand</strong> state.

            <p>
                Kedarnath has been a pilgrimage centre since ancient times. It is not certain who constructed the
                original
                <strong>Kedarnath Temple</strong> and when. A mythological account attributes the temple's construction
                to the legendary
                <strong>Pandava</strong> brothers mentioned in the <strong>Mahabharata</strong>. However, the
                <strong>Mahabharata</strong> does not mention any place
                called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the <strong>Skanda
                    Purana</strong> (c. 7th-8th
                century), which names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> released the
                holy waters of <strong>Ganga</strong>
                from his matted hair, resulting in the formation of the <strong>Ganges river</strong>.

                <br><br>

                According to the hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-Shankara-Vijaya, the 8th century
                philosopher
                <strong>Adi
                    Shankaracharya</strong> died near the Kedarnath mountains; although other hagiographies, based
                on Anandagiri's
                Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at <strong>Kanchipuram</strong>. The ruins of a
                monument marking the
                purported
                resting place of Adi Shankaracharya are located at Kedarnath. Kedarnath was definitely a prominent
                pilgrimage centre by the 12th century when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the
                <strong>Gahadavala</strong>
                minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara.

                Goa is a <strong>state</strong> on the southwestern coast of <strong>India</strong> within the region
                known as the <strong>Konkan</strong>, and geographically separated from the <strong>Deccan
                    highlands</strong> by the <strong>Western Ghats</strong>.
                It is surrounded by the Indian states of <strong>Maharashtra</strong> to the north and
                <strong>Karnataka</strong> to the east and south,
                with the <strong>Arabian Sea</strong> forming its western coast. It is India's smallest
                <strong>state</strong> by area and its
                <strong>fourth-smallest by population</strong>. Goa has the highest <strong>GDP per capita</strong>
                among all Indian states, two
                and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole. The <strong>Eleventh Finance
                    Commission</strong> of India named Goa the best-placed state because of its infrastructure, and
                India’s <strong>National
                    Commission on Population</strong> rated it as having the best quality of life in India (based on the
                commission’s
                “12 Indicators”). It is the <strong>third-highest ranking</strong> among Indian states in <strong>human
                    development index</strong>.

                <br><br>

                <strong>Panaji</strong> is the state's capital, while <strong>Vasco da Gama</strong> is its largest
                city. The historic city of <strong>Margão</strong> in
                Goa still exhibits the cultural influence of the <strong>Portuguese</strong>, who first voyaged to the
                subcontinent in
                the early 16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter, whereupon Goa became an
                <strong>overseas
                    territory of the Portuguese Empire</strong>, part of what was then known as <strong>Portuguese
                    India</strong>, and remained as
                such for about 450 years, until it was <strong>annexed by India</strong> in 1961. Goa’s official
                language, which
                is spoken by a majority of its inhabitants, is <strong>Konkani</strong>.

                <br><br>

                Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its
                white-sand beaches, active nightlife, places of worship, and <strong>World Heritage-listed
                    architecture</strong>. It also
                has rich flora and fauna because it lies on the <strong>Western Ghats</strong> range, a
                <strong>biodiversity</strong> hotspot.

                The <strong>history of Goa</strong> dates back to <strong> prehistoric times</strong>, though the
                present-day state of Goa was only
                established as recently as 1987. In spite of being <strong>India's smallest state by area</strong>,
                Goa's history is
                both long and diverse. It shares a lot of similarities with <strong>Indian history</strong>, especially
                with regard to
                <strong>colonial influences</strong> and a <strong>multi-cultural aesthetic</strong>.

                <br><br>

                The <strong>Usgalimal rock engravings</strong>, belonging to the <strong> upper paleolithic</strong> or
                <strong> mesolithic</strong> periods, exhibit some of
                the earliest traces of human settlement in India. The <strong>Mauryan</strong> and
                <strong>Satavahana</strong> Empires ruled modern-day
                Goa during the Iron Age.

                <br><br>

                During the medieval period, Goa was ruled by the <strong> Kadamba kingdom, Vijayanagara Empire, Bahmani
                    Sultanate</strong>
                and <strong> Bijapur Sultanate</strong>.

                <br><br>

                The Portuguese <strong>invaded Goa in 1510</strong>, defeating the <strong>Bijapur Sultanate</strong>.
                The Portuguese rule lasted for
                about 450 years, and heavily influenced Goan <strong>culture, cuisine, and architecture</strong>.

                <br><br>

                In 1961, the Indian Army <strong>invaded and annexed Goa</strong> after a 36 hour battle. The region
                was incorporated as
                a union territory of <strong>Goa, Daman and Diu</strong>. In 1987, Goa was granted statehood. Goa
                has one of the highest
                <strong>GDP per capita</strong> and <strong>Human Development Index</strong> among Indian states.

                <strong>Jaipur</strong> is the <strong>capital</strong> and the largest

                population of 3.1 million, making it
                the <strong>tenth most populous city</strong> in the country. Jaipur is also known as the Pink City, due
                to the dominant
                color scheme of its buildings. It is located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital <strong>New

                <strong>Vidyadhar
                    Bhattacharya</strong>. During the British Colonial period, the city served as the capital of
                <strong>Jaipur State</strong>.
                After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of
                <strong>Rajasthan</strong>.

                <br><br>

                Jaipur is a popular <strong>tourist destination in India</strong> and forms a part of the west
                <strong>Golden Triangle</strong> tourist
                circuit along with <strong>Delhi</strong> and <strong>Agra</strong> (240 km, 149 mi). It also serves as

        <div>
            <p>
                The city of Jaipur was founded by <strong>King of Amer, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II</strong> on 18
                November 1727, who
                ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amer, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to
                accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water. Jai Singh consulted several
                books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural
                guidance of <strong>Vidyadhar Bhattacharya</strong>, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of
                <strong>Vastu Shastra</strong> and
                <strong>Shilpa Shastra</strong>. The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to
                complete the major
                roads, offices, and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state
                buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built,
                pierced by seven fortified gates.

                <br><br>

                During the rule of <strong>Sawai Ram Singh</strong> I, the city was painted pink to welcome <strong>HRH
                    Albert Edward, Prince of
                    Wales</strong> (who later became <strong>King Edward VII, Emperor of India)</strong>, in 1876. Many
                of the avenues still
                remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.

                In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The wide
                boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and <strong>marble</strong>,
                fostered by a
                school of art founded in 1868. The city had three colleges, including a <strong>Sanskrit</strong>
                college (1865) and
                a girls' school (1867) opened during the reign of the <strong>Maharaja Ram Singh II</strong>.

                <br><br>

                Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of
                eight people and much damage to the city's <strong>Dravyavati River</strong>. The floods were caused by
                three days of
                cloud burst that produced more rain than the annual average.

            <p>
                Badrinath was re-established as a major pilgrimage site by <strong>Adi Shankara</strong> in the 8th
                century. In
                earlier days, pilgrims used to walk hundreds of miles to visit Badrinath temple.

                <br><br>

                The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the <strong>First
                    World War</strong>,
                the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple's staff, but the site drew thousands each
                year and up to 50,000 on its <strong>duodecennial</strong> festivals (every twelve years). In recent
                years its
                popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006
                season, compared to 90,676 in 1961. The temple in Badrinath is also a sacred pilgrimage site for
                <strong>Vaishnavites</strong>. Badrinath is also gateway to several mountaineering expeditions headed to
                mountains like
                <strong>Nilkantha</strong>.

                <strong>Agra</strong> is a city on the banks of the <strong>Yamuna</strong>
                river in the Indian state of <strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong>, about 210 kilometres (130 mi) south of the
                national capital
                <strong>New Delhi</strong>. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous
                city in Uttar
                Pradesh and <strong>twenty-third most populous city</strong> in India.

                <br><br>

                Agra's notable historical period began during <strong>Sikandar Lodi's</strong> reign, but the golden age
                of the
                city
                began with the <strong>Mughals</strong>. Agra was the foremost city of the <strong>Indian
                    subcontinent</strong> and the capital of the
                <strong>Mughal Empire</strong> under Mughal emperors <strong>Babur, Humayun, Akbar,
                    Jahangir</strong> and <strong>Shah Jahan</strong>. Under Mughal rule,
                Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion, and saw the construction of the
                <strong>Agra
                    Fort, Sikandra</strong> and Agra's most prized monument, the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong>, built
                by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for
                his favourite empress. With the decline of the Mughal empire in the late 18th century, the city fell
                successively first to <strong>Marathas</strong> and later to the <strong>East India
                    Company</strong>. After Independence, Agra has
                developed into an industrial town, with a booming tourism industry, along with footwear, leather and
                other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are <strong>UNESCO World Heritage
                    Sites</strong>. The city features
                mild winters, hot and dry summers and a <strong>monsoon</strong> season, and is famous for its
                Mughlai cuisine. Agra is
                included on the <strong>Golden Triangle</strong> tourist circuit, along with <strong>Delhi</strong>
                and Jaipur; and the <strong>Uttar Pradesh
                    Heritage Arc</strong>, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with <strong>Lucknow</strong>
                and <strong>Varanasi</strong>.

                Agra has two histories: one of the ancient city on the east, or left, bank of the river
                <strong>Yamuna</strong>, going
                back so far as to be lost in the legends of <strong>Krishna</strong> and <strong>Mahabharata</strong>
                and reestablished by <strong>Sikandar Lodhi</strong>
                in 1504-1505; the other of the modern city, founded by <strong>Akbar</strong> in 1558, on the right bank
                of the river
                which is associated with the <strong>Mughals</strong>, and known throughout the world as the city of the
                Taj. Of ancient
                Agra little now remains except a few traces of the foundations. It was a place of importance under
                various Hindu dynasties previous to the <strong>Muslim invasions of India</strong>, but its history is
                unclear, and
                possess little historical interest. Agra's period of historical importance began during <strong>Sikandar
                    Lodi's</strong> reign. In 1504-1505, Sultan <strong>Sikandar Lodi</strong> (reigned 1489–1517), the
                Afghan ruler of the <strong>Delhi
                    Sultanate</strong>, rebuilt Agra and made it the seat of government. Sikandar Lodhi appointed a
                commission which inspected and surveyed both sides of the Yamuna from <strong>Delhi</strong> to
                <strong>Etawah</strong> and finally chose
                a place on the left bank, or the east side of the Yamuna, as the site for the city. Agra on the left
                bank of the Yamuna grew into a large flourishing town with royal presence, officials, merchants,
                scholars, theologians and artists. The city became one of the most important centres of Islamic learning
                in India. The sultan founded the village of <strong>Sikandra</strong> in the northern suburbs of the
                city and built there
                a <strong>Baradari</strong> of red sandstone in 1495, which was converted into a tomb by Jahangir, and
                now stands as the
                <strong>Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani</strong>, Akbar's empress.

                <br><br>

                After the Sultan's death in 1517, the city passed on to his son, Sultan <strong>Ibrahim Lodi</strong>
                (reigned
                1517–26[16]). He ruled his sultanate from Agra until he was defeated and killed by Mughal Emperor Babur
                in the <strong>First battle of Panipat</strong>, fought in 1526.

                <strong>Jammu and Kashmir</strong> is a region administered by India as a <strong>union
                    territory</strong> and consists of the southern
                portion of the larger <strong>Kashmir</strong> region, which has been the subject of a dispute between
                India and Pakistan
                since 1947, and between India and China since 1962. <strong>The Line of Control</strong> separates Jammu
                and
                Kashmir from the <strong>Pakistani-administered</strong> territories of <strong>Azad Kashmir</strong>
                and <strong>Gilgit-Baltistan</strong> in the west and
                north. It lies to the north of the Indian states of <strong>Himachal Pradesh</strong> and
                <strong>Punjab</strong> and to the west of
                <strong>Ladakh</strong>, which is also subject to the dispute as a part of Kashmir, and administered by
                India as a union
                territory.

                <br><br>

                Provisions for the formation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir were contained within the
                <strong>Jammu
                    and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019</strong>, which was passed by both houses of the
                <strong>Parliament of India</strong> in
                August 2019. The act re-constituted the former <strong>state of Jammu and Kashmir</strong> into two
                union territories,
                Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, with effect from 31 October 2019.

                The state of <strong>Jammu and Kashmir</strong> was accorded special status by <strong>Article 370 of
                    the Constitution of India</strong>.
                In contrast to other <strong>states of India</strong>, Jammu and Kashmir had its own
                <strong>constitution, flag</strong> and
                administrative autonomy. Indian citizens from other states were not allowed to purchase land or
                property in Jammu and Kashmir.

                <br><br>

                Jammu and Kashmir had three distinct areas: Hindu-majority <strong>Jammu region</strong>,
                Muslim-majority <strong>Kashmir Valley</strong>
                and Buddhist-dominated <strong>Ladakh</strong>.[25] Unrest and violence persisted in the Kashmiri Valley
                and, following a
                disputed state election in 1987, an <strong>insurgency persisted</strong> in protest over autonomy and
                rights.

                <br><br>

                The <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party</strong> (BJP) came to power in the <strong>2014 Indian general
                    election</strong> and five years later
                included in their <strong>2019 election manifesto</strong> the revocation of Article 370 of the
                Constitution of India, in
                order to bring Jammu and Kashmir to equal status with other states.

                <br><br>

                A resolution to <strong>repeal Article 370</strong> was passed by both the houses of the
                <strong>Parliament of India</strong> in August
                2019. At the same time, a <strong>reorganisation act</strong> was also passed, which would reconstitute
                the state into
                two union territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The reorganisation took effect from 31 October
                2019.

                <br><br>

                Thousands of Kashmiris, including two former Chief Ministers and hundreds of other politicians, were
                detained in prisons all across India, the state was put under a <strong>lockdown</strong> and
                communication and
                internet services were suspended.

                Ladakh is a region administered by <strong>India</strong> as a <strong>union territory</strong>, and
                constitutes a part of
                the larger <strong>Kashmir</strong> region, which has been the subject of dispute between India,
                <strong>Pakistan</strong>, and <strong>China</strong>
                since 1947. It was established on 31 October 2019, following the passage of the <strong>Jammu and
                    Kashmir
                    Reorganisation Act</strong>. Ladakh is bordered by the <strong>Autonomous Region</strong> to the
                east, the Indian state of
                <strong>Himachal Pradesh</strong> to the south, both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu
                and Kashmir and the
                Pakistan-administered <strong>Gilgit-Baltistan</strong> to the west, and the southwest corner of
                <strong>Xinjiang</strong> across the
                <strong>Karakoram Pass</strong> in the far north. It extends from the <strong>Siachen Glacier</strong>
                in the <strong>Karakoram</strong> range to the north
                to the main Great <strong>Himalayas</strong> to the south. The eastern end, consisting of the
                uninhabited <strong>Aksai
                    Chin</strong> plains, is claimed by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, and has been under
                Chinese control
                since <strong>1962</strong>.

                <br><br>

                In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade
                routes, but as the Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh
                in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the <strong>Government of India</strong> has
                successfully
                encouraged <strong>tourism in Ladakh</strong>. As Ladakh is a part of the strategically important
                Kashmir
                region, the
                <strong>Indian military</strong> maintains a strong presence in the region.

                The largest town in Ladakh is <strong>Leh</strong>, followed by <strong>Kargil</strong>,
                each of which headquarters a district. The
                <strong>Leh district</strong> contains the <strong>Indus, Shyok</strong> and
                <strong>Nubra</strong> river valleys. The <strong>Kargil district</strong> contains the
                <strong>Suru,
                    Dras</strong> and <strong>Zanskar</strong> river valleys. The main populated regions are
                the river valleys, but the mountain
                slopes also support the pastoral <strong>Changpa</strong> nomads. The main religious groups
                in the region are <strong>Muslims</strong>
                (mainly <strong>Shia</strong>) (46%), <strong>Tibetan Buddhists</strong> (40%),
                <strong>Hindus</strong> (12%) and others (2%). Ladakh is one of the
                most sparsely populated regions in India. As its culture and history are closely related to
                that of
                <strong>Tibet</strong>, it is known as the "Little Tibet".

                <br><br>

                Ladakh is the <strong>largest</strong> and the <strong>second least populous</strong> union
                territory of India.

                Rock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from
                <strong>Neolithic</strong>
                times. Ladakh's earliest inhabitants consisted of a mixed <strong>Indo-Aryan</strong> population of Mons
                and
                <strong>Dards</strong>, who find mention in the works of <strong>Herodotus</strong>, and classical
                writers as well as the Indian
                <strong>Puranas</strong>. Around the 1st century, Ladakh was a part of the <strong>Kushan
                    Empire</strong>. <strong>Buddhism</strong> spread into
                western Ladakh from Kashmir in the 2nd century. The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes
                the region in his accounts. <strong>Xuanzang's</strong> term of Ladakh is Mo-lo-so, which has been
                reconstructed by
                academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa, which is believed to have been the original name of the
                region.

                <br><br>

                For much of the first millennium, the western Tibet comprised <strong>Zhangzhung</strong> kingdom(s),
                which practised the
                <strong>Bon religion</strong>. Sandwiched between Kashmir and Zhangzhung, Ladakh is believed to have
                been alternatively
                under the control of one or other of these powers. Academics find strong influences of Zhangzhung
                language and culture in "upper Ladakh" (from the middle section of the Indus valley to the
                southeast). The penultimate king of Zhangzhung is said to have been from Ladakh.

                <br><br>

                From around 660 CE, Central Tibet and China started contesting the "four garrisons" of the <strong>Tarim
                    Basin</strong>
                (present day <strong>Xinjiang</strong>), a struggle that lasted three centuries. Zhangzhung fell victim
                to Tibet's
                ambitions in c. 634 and disappeared for ever. Kashmir's <strong>Karkota Empire</strong> and the
                <strong>Umayyad Caliphate</strong> too
                joined the contest for Xinjiang soon afterwards. Baltistan and Ladakh were at the centre of these
                struggles. Academics infer from the slant of Ladakhi chronicles that Ladakh may have owed its
                primary allegiance to Tibet during this time, but that it was more political than cultural. Ladakh
                remained Buddhist and its culture was not yet Tibetan.

                <strong>Shimla</strong> also known as <strong>Simla</strong>, is the
                capital and the largest city of the <strong>Indian state</strong> of <strong>Himachal
                    Pradesh</strong>. In 1864, Shimla was declared as
                the <strong>summer capital</strong> of <strong>British India</strong>. After
                <strong>independence</strong>, the city became the capital of <strong>Punjab</strong> and was
                later made the capital of <strong>Himachal Pradesh</strong>. It is the principal commercial,
                cultural and educational
                centre of the state. It was the capital city in exile of <strong>British Burma</strong> (present-day
                <strong>Myanmar</strong>) from 1942
                to 1945.

                <br><br>

                Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic
                conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the
                <strong>Himalayas</strong>. As the
                summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the <strong>Simla Accord of
                    1914</strong>
                and
                the <strong>Simla Conference</strong> of 1945. After independence, the state of <strong>Himachal
                    Pradesh</strong> came into being in
                1948
                as a result of the integration of 28 <strong>princely states</strong>. Even after independence, the city
                remained an
                important political centre, hosting the <strong>Simla</strong> Agreement of 1972. After the
                reorganisation of the
                state
                of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.

                architectures
                dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture
                and
                churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Major city

                <strong>Kalka–Shimla Railway</strong> line built by the British, a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage
                    Site</strong>, is also a major
                tourist
                attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race <strong>MTB
                    Himalaya</strong>, which
                started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the
                largest <strong>natural ice skating rink</strong> in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the
                city is also
                an

            <p>
                Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only
                civilisation was the <strong>Jakhu Temple</strong> and a few scattered houses. The area was called
                'Shimla', named after a <strong>Hindu goddess</strong>, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of
                <strong>Kali</strong>.

                <br><br>

                The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by <strong>Bhimsen Thapa</strong> of
                <strong>Nepal</strong> in 1806. The <strong>British
                    East India Company</strong> took control of the territory as per the <strong>Sugauli Treaty</strong>
                after the <strong>Anglo-Nepalese War</strong>
                (1814–16). The <strong>Gurkha</strong> leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the
                command of <strong>David
                    Ochterlony</strong> in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who
                surveyed the
                area, describe Shimla as "a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the
                travellers". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the <strong>Hill
                    States</strong>, set up a wood
                cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the <strong>Scottish</strong> civil servant
                <strong>Charles Pratt Kennedy</strong>
                built the first <strong>pucca house</strong> in the area named Kennedy Cottage in 1822, near
                <strong>Annadale</strong>, what is now the
                home for CPWD office. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British
                officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their
                entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, <strong>William Amherst</strong>, the <strong>Governor-General of
                    Bengal</strong>, visited Shimla and
                stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, <strong>Stapleton Cotton</strong>, the Commander-in-Chief of
                the British
                forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were
                constructed near <strong>Jakhoo</strong>. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the
                chiefs of <strong>Keonthal</strong>
                and <strong>Patiala</strong> in exchange for the Rawin <strong>pargana</strong> and a portion of the
                Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew
                rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.

                <strong>New Delh</strong> is the <strong>capital</strong> of

                    Delhi</strong>. New Delhi is the seat
                of all three branches of the <strong>government of India</strong>, hosting the <strong>Rashtrapati
                    Bhavan, Parliament House</strong>, and

                Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the <strong>National
                    Capital

                part of the
                city of Delhi. The <strong>National Capital Region</strong> is a much larger entity comprising the

                designed by British architects <strong>Edwin Lutyens</strong> and <strong>Herbert Baker</strong>. The
                new capital was inaugurated on 13

            <p>
                Until December 1911 <strong>Calcutta</strong> was the capital of India during the British Raj. However,
                it had become the
                centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century, which led to the
                <strong>Partition of
                    Bengal</strong> by Viceroy <strong>Lord Curzon</strong>. This created massive political and
                religious upsurge including political
                assassinations of British officials in Calcutta. The anti-colonial sentiments amongst the public led to
                a complete boycott of British goods, which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and
                immediately shift the capital to New Delhi.

                <br><br>

                <strong>Old Delhi</strong> had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of
                <strong>ancient India</strong> and the <strong>Delhi Sultanate</strong>, most notably of the
                <strong>Mughal Empire</strong> from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the
                British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire, as India was officially named,
                from Calcutta on the east coast, to Delhi. The <strong>Government of British India</strong> felt that it
                would be logistically easier to administer India from Delhi, which is in the centre of northern India.
                The land for building the new city of Delhi was acquired under the <strong>Land Acquisition Act
                    1894</strong>.

                <br><br>

                During the <strong>Delhi Durbar</strong> on 12 December 1911, <strong>George V, Emperor of
                    India</strong>, while laying the foundation
                stone for the viceroy's residence in the <strong>Coronation Park, Kingsway Camp</strong>, declared that
                the capital of
                the Raj would be shifted from <strong>Calcutta</strong> to <strong>Delhi</strong>. Three days later,
                George V and his
                consort, <strong>Queen Mary</strong>, laid the foundation stone of New Delhi at Kingsway Camp. Large
                parts of New
                Delhi were planned by <strong>Edwin Lutyens</strong>, who first visited Delhi in 1912, and
                <strong>Herbert Baker</strong>, both leading
                20th-century British architects. The contract was given to <strong>Sobha Singh</strong>. The original
                plan called for
                its construction in Tughlaqabad, inside the <strong>Tughlaqabad Fort</strong>, but this was given up
                because of the
                Delhi-Calcutta trunk line that passed through the fort. Construction really began after
                <strong>World War I</strong> and was completed by 1931. The gardening and planning of plantations was
                led by <strong>A.E.P.
                    Griessen</strong>, and later William Mustoe. The city that was later dubbed "<strong>Lutyens'
                    Delhi</strong>" was inaugurated
                in ceremonies beginning on 10 February 1931 by Viceroy <strong>Lord Irwin</strong>. Lutyens designed the
                central
                administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain's <strong>imperial aspirations</strong>.

                <strong>Rishikesh</strong>, also spelt as <strong>Hrishikesh</strong>, is a city governed by
                <strong>Rishikesh Municipal Corporation</strong> (since
                October 2017), and a <strong>tehsil</strong> in <strong>Dehradun district</strong> of the Indian
                <strong>state Uttarakhand</strong>. Located in the
                foothills of the <strong>Himalayas</strong> in northern India, it is known as the "Gateway to the
                <strong>Garhwal Himalayas</strong>" and
                "Yoga Capital of the World". It lies 21 km (13 mi) north of the city <strong>Haridwar</strong> and 45 km
                (28 mi)
                southeast of the state capital <strong>Dehradun</strong>. Rishikesh has an approximate population of
                between 252,533 and
                320,222, making it the seventh most populated city in the state of <strong>Uttarakhand</strong>. It is
                known as the
                pilgrimage town and regarded as one of the holiest places for <strong>Hindus</strong>. Hindu sages and
                saints have
                visited Rishikesh since ancient times to meditate in search of higher knowledge.

                <br><br>

                In September 2015, the Union tourism minister <strong>Mahesh Sharma</strong> announced that Rishikesh
                and Haridwar will
                be the first in India to be given the title of "twin national heritage cities". Due to the religious
                significance of the place, non-vegetarian food and alcohol are strictly prohibited in Rishikesh. The
                city has hosted the annual International Yoga Festival on the first week of March since 1989.

                Rishikesh has been a part of the legendary "Kedarkhand". Legends state that Lord <strong>Rama</strong>
                did penance
                here for killing <strong>Ravana</strong>, the <strong>asura</strong> king of <strong>Lanka</strong>; and
                <strong>Lakshmana</strong>, his younger brother, crossed the river
                <strong>Ganges</strong>, using two jute ropes at the point where the present '<strong>Lakshman
                    Jhula</strong>' (लक्ष्मण झूला) stands
                today. The 'Kedarkhand' of <strong>Skanda Purana</strong>, also mentions the existence of Indrakund at
                this very
                point. The jute-rope bridge was replaced by a 248-foot long iron-rope <strong>suspension bridge</strong>
                in 1889. After
                it was washed away in the 1924 floods, it was replaced in 1927 by the present stronger bridge built by
                the United Provinces Public Works Department. This bridge connects the two districts of Tapovan, Tehri
                and Jonk, Pauri Garhwal. Another similar suspension bridge <strong>Ram Jhula</strong> was built in 1986
                at nearby
                Sivananda Nagar.

                In contemporary history, one finds the mention of Rishikesh in The Gazeteer of Dehra Dun, by ICS office
                HG Walton. It reads, <q> <em>A village or town beautifully situated on the right bank of the Ganges, on
                        a high cliff overlooking the river. The place is developing very rapidly, especially since the
                        construction of the new bridge over the Song river, the realignment of the pilgrim road from
                        Raiwala to Rishikesh</em>. </q>

                <br><br>

                The <strong>Ganges</strong>, one of the most sacred rivers to <strong>Hindus</strong>, flows through
                Rishikesh. Here the river leaves
                the <strong>Shivalik Hills</strong> in the <strong>Himalayas</strong> and flows into the plains of
                northern India. Several <strong>temples</strong>,
                ancient and new, are along the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh. <strong>Shatrughna Mandir</strong>,
                Bharat Mandir (<strong>Lord
                    Vishnu's avatar</strong>), Lakshman Mandir are the ancient temples established by <strong>Adi
                    Shankaracharya</strong>. Shatrughna
                Temple is near <strong>Ram Jhula</strong> and Lakshman Mandir is situated near Lakshman Jhula.

                <br><br>

                The historical records mention that some pilgrims used to stay at Rishikesh as a resting place before
                moving onwards to the higher mountains for the pilgrimage while a larger number used to visit Rishikesh
                as the original destination and visited various sites between Rishikesh and Lakshman Jhula before
                returning. However, Rishikesh has in recent decades shifted from a pilgrim to a tourist town. The
                International Yoga Festival introduced in 2000 has brought a new influx of tourists. Local markets have
                evolved from commercialising goods such as "local and religious handicrafts" to a more service-oriented
                tourist industry with "provision stores, cafes, hotels and yoga and meditation" as well as rafting.
